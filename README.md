Brief Project Description:
Our group project will utilize processing to create an interactive game for users to enjoy. The objective of the game is for the main character to defeat all its enemies before its lives run out. Our game will feature moving enemy attackers which will have certain sequences of symbols that the user will have to correctly draw in order to win. Once these symbols are recognized by their corresponding slopes, the enemy attacker will be defeated.

Directions:

To run the game with music, import the Processing Foundation's Sound Library for Processing. To install, go to Sketch --> Import Library --> Add Library --> Type in "Sound" --> Select and Install.
Go to the "help" tab for technical instructions and controls to play the game.



Development Log:

5/24/21:

Reshmi: Created repo and initialized main files (DoodleProject and Protaganist), set up background and canvas formatting, displayed number of lives on the top left of the canvas.

Michelle: Created repo. Set up the basic functions for the Protagonist object (e.g Display() method).

5/26/21:
Reshmi: Began end screen situation, researched adding music libraries to our code, and tested with Michelle the practicality of drawing symbols (we worked on an issue with the shift key).

Michelle: Added functionality for the player to draw symbols anywhere on the screen. The symbol will then be analyzed for its type and will kill any enemy with that corresponding symbol.

5/28/21:

Reshmi: Worked with Michelle during class to finalize enemy behavior and symbols for the user to detect and counterattack.

Michelle: Added two new symbols for the player to create: the carrot and the downwards carrot.

6/2/21: (3 hour Zoom call together)

Reshmi: Created and formatted characters for the protagonist and enemies. Coded the lose / end screen situation.

Michelle: Edited movement for enemies. Tweaked some methods that had to change due to the different protagonist and enemy model.

6/9/21: (4 hour Zoom Call together)

Reshmi: Debugged together and worked to add panels to feature dialogue that could be toggled on and off when playing the round. Found sources for background images/objects and began to code background music.

Michelle:


6/10/21:

Reshmi: Finished cutscenes by adding dialogue, background changes, character exits, and the tools that needed to be collected (panel, antenna, propane). Added background music, pause/play keys, and updated instructions.
