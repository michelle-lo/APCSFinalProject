Brief Project Description:
Our group project will utilize processing to create an interactive game for users to enjoy. The objective of the game is for the main character to defeat all its enemies before its lives run out. Our game will feature moving enemy attackers which will have certain sequences of symbols that the user will have to correctly draw in order to win. Once these symbols are recognized by their corresponding slopes, the enemy attacker will be defeated.
